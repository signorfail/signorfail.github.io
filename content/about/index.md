Hello, I'm Eugene! I used to be a senior tech product and project manager based in Tokyo, Japan. As of 2020, I'm now based in Daejeon, South Korea.

I enjoy building and shipping things that leverage on technology to help people reduce complexity in their lives by using systems or platforms built on machine learning. Whether it's a website or an app powered by AI or anything in between, my goal is to ship products that provide value, ease-of-use & performance to my users.

I started out in tech product management after being assigned the role during my time in [188BET](https://www.188bet.com/) in 2009 and served as a product manager there till 2014.
From there, I gained further experience working in different industries and countries in tech and engineering positions before joining [Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.co.jp/) in 2017 where I worked on projects in the Japan Tech Division.

Here are some tools & technologies that I'm familiar with:
