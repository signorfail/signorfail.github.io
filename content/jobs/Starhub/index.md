- I served as the Product manager of the Company’s data management platform for user segmentation and targeting.
- This project required end-to-end product delivery from approval to release within a short timeframe of ~1 quarter, which the team achieved within time and budget.
- We worked closely with Oracle’s technical team to setup the Bluekai system and assisted 3rd party partners on troubleshooting onboarding issues onto our platform.
