- As this was a startup, I performed various duties such as management of hardware inventory & software systems used by the Company.
- I was also involved in planning, testing, deploying, maintaining and performing sysadmin and devops for the Companyâ€™s front and backend systems along with a small team.
- I worked with our in-house media team to add value to in-house media assets such as videos and images by adding subtitling or translations using Adobe Photoshop & Premiere Pro.
